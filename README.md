# NLP_F22
Repo for Natural Language Processing with Representation Learning, Fall 2022

This is the repository for the final project for the course, creating a weakly-supervised model to obtain ESG sin/green scores based on Reddit posts about a company and SEC filings.

We built two models (classification and regression) in an attempt to reconcile between classes of institutions and investors with differently abled access to information.
