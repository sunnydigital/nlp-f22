amgn,2018,"each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three vegf receptors.to optimally inhibit the vegf pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three vegf receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis:vegf receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis;vegf receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and,vegf receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation.preclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three vegf receptors that is designed to optimize vegf blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.with that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this.tkis have recently revolutionized the treatment of rcc while inhibitors of vegf pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with rcc. there are five known vegf ligands (a, b, c, d, plgf) and three vegf receptors (1, 2 and 3). their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the eu since august 2017.  with an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib. their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development. the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. the updated phase ii data to be presented in october of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients. the unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects. the stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since july. the results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression. $aveo - aveo pharma dd bois #**$aveo – aveo pharmaceuticals****overview:**aveo pharmaceuticals (aveo oncology, for some reason they have one name for their company and one for their website) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing targeted treatments for oncology and other unmet medical needs. the most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63. preliminary antineoplastic activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at mtd and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater. the data in phase i showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of phase ii i believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.",0.7170427805

csx,2021,"lots of unexpected things can come up and sometimes the stock gets bought up leading to the report and then dumped. rail is king and wab is solid imo.also bidens infrastructure plan calls for more rail movement and rail traffic is already increasing, so i think this is a great short term play too.no rockets or calls, just a solid stock. the company is heavily involved in the power management sector and likely will provide many of the electrical components and assemblies needed to build out the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure detailed in the american jobs plan's investments into clean tech and clean energy.the #4, #5, and #10 holdings are railroad companies norfolk southern (nsc), kansas city southern (ksu), and csx corp. (csx). and options are still very cheap at the moment.here is everything you need to know about the etf from seeking alpha:the global x . infrastructure development etf (pave) is in an excellent position to directly benefit from president biden's american jobs plan that was announced on wednesday in pittsburgh, pa. the proposed plan targets over $1.4 trillion for direct investments into physical infrastructure including transportation, schools, hospitals, and buildings as well as for energy, water, and digital infrastructure. the investment thesis here is simple: find an infrastructure fund that can benefit directly from those investment dollars.let's take a look at the pave etf and see what its prospects are going forward.top holdingsthe pave infrastructure development etf's top-10 holdings can be found on global x etf website and equate to roughly 30% of what i would characterize as a moderately concentrated portfolio that holds a total of 101 companies.pave has ~$2.3 billion in assets, so even a 3.2% weight of #1 holding deere (de) results in a $80.5 million stake. you guessed it wab (wabtec).they recently made some acquisitions with ge, and a lot of talks about electric freight locomotives. pave is a buy. railroads are a lifeblood to american supply lines that tend to do alright even in bad years. you might be thinking what railroad is the best? pulling freight with locomotives is still the best way to transport large amounts of goods. previous years had much higher numbers but csx did major efficiency cuts in 2017 that removed thousands of employees and areas that weren't running well. ph is also up 170%+ over the past year, has a forward p/e=22.4x, and yields 1.1%.the eaton corp.

cvs,2021,"this [article]() on investopedia gets into some of the details regarding the relationship between commodities and inflation. they have a strong pharmaceutical presence like the other companies in this category though over half of their revenue is actually from their grocery segment.what makes them an interesting inflation play is that their stores are literally giant baskets of goods. with short-sellers circling rad stock with a 16% short float, one would think that reddit’s wallstreetbets would look at the turnaround pharmaceutical retailer more closely.rite aid should join reddit’s meme stock rally for two reasons: short-squeezing hedge funds and the company’s name. teladoc's solutions can offer exactly what is needed and can reinforce each other to drive broader engagement across the platform.and teladoc is in a leading position to make whole-person virtual care delivery a reality, especially through its primary360 platform, which functions as the gateway to enabling fully integrated whole-person care delivery. cvs owns a pharmacy benefits manager which, as a business, is incentivized through proportional rebates to push pricier drugs where they can.from the retail perspective, their ""front"" stores are essentially baskets of goods which can pass on the costs of inflation to the consumer.lastly, the most intriguing reason (in my opinion) is their current strategy to pay down long-term debt. since the end of february, shares are in a continuous downtrend and are down more than 40% ytd and around 60% since its all-time highs in february, compared to a 25% ytd gain for the s&amp;p 500.and while the company continued to report strong growth rates, investors seem concerned about the sustainability of the company's growth and path to profitability. folks seemed to get something out of that post so i thought i'd post part 2 to wsb.do keep in mind that this is analysis of his stock picks for q2 2021 and that his views on the economy have likely changed given the evergrande situation (this is my own speculation based on his tweets from this week).by my estimate, 28.4% of scion's q2 2021 portfolio is currently hedging against inflation. telehealth has enabled to eliminate major healthcare system constraints, ., hospital beds and physician visiting hours that were needed for taking care of covid patients while capacities for regular in-patient visits in chronic or mental care were almost completely eliminated.on the basis of a recent study by mckinsey, teladoc estimates that the opportunity for telehealth adoption in the us alone could represent up to $261 billion.it is important to highlight that this opportunity still needs to be fully realized as the industry is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. tdoc then picked up a bit of momentum in early 2021, reaching an ath of 308 in february. teladoc actually reported positive adjusted ebitda when excluding sbc (which accounted for 85% of the quarter's net loss) and some other smaller items.the impact from sbc on profitability is expected to decrease over the coming quarters, and when it does we expect teladoc to make significant steps towards gaap profitability.irrespective of this teladoc is already showing its cash-generating potential as the company posted a positive operating cash flow of $111 million over the past 9 months, which increased the overall cash position to $823.8m.goss margins remained in line with previous quarters, but adjusted ebitda margins showed a slight decrease in q3 vs. prior quarters.teladoc also boosted its 2021 revenue outlook to between $2.015 to $2.025 billion, compared to ~$2.0b analyst consensus, indicating a ~85% yoy growth at the midpoint. teladoc is continuing to provide industry-leading quality of services while expanding geographically and from a product-offerings perspective which is key to maintaining its leadership position moving forward. teladoc posted another set of strong topline growth rates in its most recent quarter, while also boosting its full-year revenue guidance.",0.8806721538

gm,2017,"$f / $gm or $bmw puts.. latest trump tweets. and then there is the announcement of removing chevy off the shelves of emerging markets such as india. they will also see if there is some liquidity in the screen markets...usually good for smaller trades.for big trades this isn't good enough. anyone planning on purchasing ford or gm puts due to the recent trump tweets?another idea would be to purchase puts for bmw, but i'm not sure if i can purchase options for foreign exchanges with my broker.sources:-hits-back-at-trump-criticism-of-refugee-policy-and-bmw-tariff-threat-german-automakers-will-pay-tariff-on-cars-built-outside-u-s/?utm_term=.d6994c122f4d is this the beginning of the end of an iconic automaker. this quarter's gm earnings were a disaster. this can easily double the amount of buying pressure out there and lead to very exaggerated moves.as the stock goes up, so does the delta of the stocks calls and dealers who were originally perfectly delta hedged before the move effectively become short the stock as it moves higher so they need to buy more stock to “hedge up” or flatten their exposure/risk.they are also highlighting big “wiseguy trades” ...big call trades most likely put on by a hedge fund or other large institution that are likely betting on an expected large near term move...so when stocks gap up dealers need to rush and rehedge or risk getting short as that move plays out.worst thing for a dealer who is short large options is gap risk...can't really hedge against that risk except by buying other options beforehand which can get expensive for them.almost all the large option trades are traded through sell side (brokerage firms) option trading desks. there is no liquidity in most stock options (besides index) to trade 5k+ contracts at a clip w/o dramatically affecting the price or ie: affecting the options volatility assumptionsexample:i am a trader at a hedge fund and i call a brokerage firm options trading desk and say i want to buy the $gm april 40 calls or say “give me a menu” (for bigger trades)....screen has them 35c/40c...they respond, 1k at 40c, 2500 @45c or 5k @50ci'll say ""i paid you 50c for 5k""now they are instantly naked short the callsthen they go and see if1) they have a view on the stock or it helps their overall risk to hold onto them so they may decide to keep them (rare)2) see if they can get out of the risk w/o moving the market...first to clients or there is a whole brokers broker market where dealers can offload some risk w/o going to clients or the public. then:3) they will try to hedge themselves by buying other options...either higher strike or create synthetic calls (buy puts + buy stock) but this is expensive and hurts potential gains they were hoping for on trade4) just buy the amount of stock of the option delta...with gm at say 37 the april 40's are ~.20 delta so they would have to buy 100k of stock (5000 calls x 100 multiplier = 500k shares x .20 delta = 100k to be currently delta hedged).this works until stock jumps 5% and the call delta goes from .2 to .4 and the dealer is forced to buy 100k more stock to hedge his delta risk otherwise he effectively become short the other 100k shares.gm is an easy example but imagine a stock that only trades 200k a day and a dealer is short 5k calls...the buying snowballs and that's when you see a 3% move quickly turn into a 10% move for no other reason than dealers freaking out about their risk...and as they buy more stock the stock goes even higher &amp; so does the delta causing them to need to buy even more = stock going parabolic scenario..i’ll also add that when a stock starts moving up quickly for no obvious reason nobody wants to short it or even sell a long position because people naturally think that someone knows about some positive news coming out and the recent large call buying adds credibility to that thought process. or do you you think if there is something they can do to turn it around? is this a fall that cannot be checked? after goldman sachs downgrade, is $gm even worth it in the long run?",0.88436376

nwl,2018,"lets take a quick look at what newell actually does. what we are looking to profit off of is the vote coming up at their 2018 shareholders meeting that will decide who gets control of the board - which will in turn decide the direction of the company.this all started when michael polk (the current ceo) decided to [aquire jarden](-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/newell-brands-announces-completion-of-newell-rubbermaid-and-jarden-corporation-combination/) back in 2016. only reason this is important is because it is the jarden chairman and ceo, martin franklin, that accuses michael polk of mismanaging the brands. let's look at the facts: - newell has been terribly mismanaged to get to a point where they are trying to unwind half the company despite many of these brands having synergy- the recent string of board resignations culminating with the resignation of kevin conroy who then [threw his support]() towards starboard is a strong indicator of the momentum starboard has among key shareholders- with the share price popping 6% after the news of conroy adding support to starboard, it is clear general shareholder sentiment is in favor of the change in power- you guys jizz over pe and this newell's pe is currently low as fuck (5.6 ttm)the premium for options have always been pretty cheap in my opinion for this company so join me in buying calls on what should be a nice short term spike when polk inevitably gets booted. normie brands - dd (a look into the corporate struggle at newell brands) so recently there was a post on the front page whining about the lack of dd in this sub and it got me thinking. under newell's various business units you can find brands like: rubbermaid, rawlings, marmot, coleman, sharpie, elmers, calphalon, graco, and the list goes on. to really spice things up, carl ichan has recently [taken a ""large position""](-03-01/icahn-reveals-newell-brands-stake-as-starboard-pushes-for-change) in newell but claims to be undecided on which camp he will vote in favor of.where this leaves us is a nice opportunity to bet that the vote will go in favor of franklin and starboard which should lead to a spike in the short term share price. they published a [letter](-content/uploads/starboard_value_lp_letter_to_nwl_ceo_and_board_02.12.) that, in summary, says polk doesn't know what the fuck he is doing and also listed their candidates for board elections at the upcoming shareholder conference. since most of you are too retarded to generate an original thought i'll get you up to date on a nice yolo with a company i've never seen anybody talk about in this sub (and for good reason): newell brands. possibly the most boring company i've ever looked into, newell is a marketer of consumer and commercial brands. now i'm not sure what michael polk was smoking when he hatched this plan, but in a complete reversal from the growth plan that had been laid out in prior years, newell announced they were planning [to sell off nearly half their brands](). a year after this acquisition investors were expecting big results, but newell delivered just the opposite.",0.5160299899

tel,2021,"once it gets into the low 20’s it starts becoming oversold. currently ast has predicted price targets of $35 (deutsche bank) and $29 (barclays). additionally, the low operating cost allows ast to competitively price their product in their target markets. this spectrum is not used in mobile terrestrial, and would require a shift from manufacturers of chip sets and mobile phones to integrate them in the future. though everything in this presentation focuses on the telecommunications aspect of ast, there have been mentions by the company of entering other markets such as home broadband, internet of things, and military/defense. combining the facts above with the executed commercial agreements and mou’s, ast has established a large moat between the competition that we believe will not be closed within the next 10 years.&amp;#x200b;**additional comments:** i don't state any price targets in this post because i am simply analyzing the business as it is. gogo's products and services are installed on thousands of business aircraft of all sizes and mission types from turboprops to the largest global jets, and are utilized by the largest fractional ownership operators, charter operators, corporate flight departments and individuals.currently, there are 2,000 business aircraft flying with gogo's avance l5 or l3 system installed. and asts upcoming constellation launching from 2022, just like the qualcom x65 chip, is really the only very high throughput constellation designed to talk directly to cellular phones.it should, in my opinion, not be bad news for ast spacemobile that the leading phone and chip makers adopt to connect better to their type of constellation.disclosure: i have an investment in ast space mobile.so lets sort the arguments on this one out, bulls and bears. you get this value equivalent of $16.5 per share of dual use pnt and the smallsat subsidiary ""for free"" buying the cellular connectivity main operation at a value arrived at using 25% discount rate and only 30% of projected positive future cash  flows from the cellular connectivity.if we add that disregarded $16.5 / share value to the average analyst targets of $32 based on cellular cashflows, **we arrive at a $50 per share fair current value**. some express bearish sentiment on ast spacemobile on this rumor, so that may explain a red premarket.but here is my take:the rumor of globalstar possibly using their weaker satellites and narrow spectrum to connect to iphones should not discourage investors from appreciating the fact that new cellular phones will have improved ability to connect to low earth orbit constellations using any suitable cellular spectrum. so, don't act on anything written above.) so there can easily be more positions that may have been opened.",0.7230192525

(again this is not investment advice, i hate oil companies because they are morally bankrupt and responsible for the ransacking of the planet and impending climate crisis). additionally, simulated gaming and real money gaming run off the same back-end platform, meaning that any user data acquired during the simulated-phase is extremely valuable once the switch is “turned on” to allow for real bets to be placed. but as with our other potential acquisition targets, the real opportunity would be for gan to remain independent.in a gold rush, a given prospector may or may not get rich... but a company selling ""picks and shovels"" will always prosper.",0.7497417722
xray,2021,"as of now, only about ⅓ of align’s customers are from asian markets, where a huge potential consumer population lies. align dominates dental technology inside and outside of the doctor’s offices. align technologies super long thesis **full disclosure: this isn't a gambling or short-term dd and my positions aren't in options for this play, but considering the massive inflow of new members i suppose that at least some of them are fundamental value investors who want sustainable growth and stocks not volatile derivatives. approximately 84% of align’s business still comes from invisalign however, and that’s probably a good thing as invisalign is their flagship product that has years of research behind it which makes it inherently a high-margin good because each invisalign update is just a minor successive improvement. as more consumers strive towards wanting dental perfection as a norm, convenience and technology will be #1 on the list for them. dentsply is also not even profitable, while align enjoys a *net profit* margin of 68% (this means after every good is sold, every employee is paid, and every interest payment is made, align will keep 68% of the money they made on selling their invisalign *and itero* products).on top of this, we see revenue growth of over 25% year on year, which is outstanding for such a product. due to align’s ***clear*** product superiority, we can expect a massive exodus from traditional braces towards invisible aligners, and this estimate of the possible market share capture would be pretty fair to assume. here’s the final line:***we expect our utilization rates to gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology, which continue to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of invisalign clear aligners. in 2019, we trained 22,270 new invisalign doctors of which 9,765 were trained in the americas region and 12,505 in the international region.”and the cherry on top will be an administration change that will take the us out of a trade war with china: “on a year-over-year basis, our international invisalign volume increased 34.0% driven primarily by increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base in both the emea and apac regions. on top of this algn has seen very low volatility in terms of price movement as well, it has basically been a straight line of appreciation so those with a smaller appetite for risk would love to have this one in their portfolio.invisalign suggestion rates show us that the usage of align’s flagship product has yet to reach its full potential.on top of this, invisalign is aggressively expanding overseas:“we continue to expand our invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors. the moat of having orthodontist connections and a 20 year old product line demonstrates that the growth seen here will be sustainable for generations to come.on top of this, align has seen zero issues in liquidity with a significant increase in free cash flow in the past 4 years. the orthodontics industry as a whole as varying amounts of estimated cagrs, from 8-13% depending on the source.",0.6781174777
